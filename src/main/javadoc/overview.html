        <h1>Overview</h1>
        
        <p>The <b>Hammer Framework</b> is a fully compliant JSR-330 dependency
            injection implementation.  It is a lighter weight alternative to other
            popular JSR-330 implementations such as Guice, Spring, HK2, and others.
            In addition to its leaner API and simpler configuration, it has a smaller
            runtime footprint of most of the alternatives and a faster
            runtime bootstrapping time.
        </p>
        <!-- and some unique features for injecting multiple implementations of the
            same interface. (forthcoming) -->

        <h1>Usage</h1>
        
        <h2>Basic Injection</h2>
        
        <p>The {@link hammer.api.Injector Injector} is the main dependency injection
            interface for the hammer framework.  In order to acquire an instance of an
            {@code Injector}, a single {@link hammer.api.Container Container} instance
            is configured and manipulated using one or more 
            {@link hammer.api.Loader Loader} implementations.  This all happens in the
            context of a call to one of the static 
            {@link hammer.api.Hammer Hammer.createInjector} methods which returns a fully
            configured and ready to use {@code Injector}.
        </p>
        
        <p>The {@link hammer.api.Container Container} is configured by adding injectable
            concrete classes (or fully instantiated instances) via the {@code addImpl} or
            {@code addInstance} methods.  These calls can then be further configured to
            indicate under what conditions the configured injectable class will be
            injected (i.e. for what types and qualifiers).  For example, consider the
            following concrete class which is legally injectable according to the
            rules of the
            <a href="https://atinject.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/index.html">
                JSR-330 specification</a>:
        </p>
                
        <pre>
  public class GameService implements Service {
    private final Handicapper handicapper;

    &#064;Inject
    GameService(Handicapper handicapper) {
      this.handicapper = handicapper;
    }

    public Game startGame(Player... players) {
      ...
    }

    &#064;Override
    public void start() { ... }

    &#064;Override
    public void stop() { ... }
  }
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Injectable Value (via concrete class type, no qualifier)</h3>
        
        <p>In order to inject a {@code GameService}, it must be added to the
            {@code Container} using a {@code Loader}.  Since it also depends on 
            a {@code Handicapper}, an implementation of that type must also be added to
            the container:
        </p>
        
        <pre>
  public class GameLoader implements Loader {
    &#064;Override
    public void load(Container container) {
      // configure the GameService to be injected for requests of its own type
      container.addImplType(GameService.class)
               .asStrictBinding()
               .forItself();

      // configure a FairHandicapper to be injected for requests of a Handicapper
      container.addImplType(FairHandicapper.class)
               .asStrictBinding()
               .forSpecificTypes(Handicapper.class);
    }
  });
        </pre>
        
        <p>Using the above {@code Loader}, an {@code Injector} can be created and used
            to acquire an instance of {@code GameService}:
        </p>
        
        <pre>
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // configure the container and create the injector
    Injector injector = Hammer.createInjector(new GameLoader());

    // get an instance of GameService
    GameService gs = injector.getInstance(GameService.class);
  }
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Injectable Value (via interface type, no qualifier)</h3>
        
        <p>Notice that the {@code GameService} is injected "forItself" in the above
            {@code Loader}.  Rather than configuring the injector to inject it for
            requests of its own type, you can also configure the {@code GameService} to
            be injected for requests of {@code Service} instances:
        </p>
        
        <pre>
  container.addImplType(GameService.class).asStrictBinding().forSpecificTypes(Service.class);
        </pre>
        
        <p>Now injection requests for an instance of {@code Service} will return a
            {@code GameService}.
        </p>
        
        <pre>
  // will be an instance of GameService
  Service gs = injector.getInstance(Service.class);
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Injectable Value (via either class or interface type with qualifier)</h3>
        
        <p>Injections using qualifiers are fully supported with hammer.  In order to
            configure an injection request to be associated with a specific qualifier,
            use the {@code whenQualifiedBy} method that is fluently available when
            setting up strict bindings:
        </p>
        
        <pre>
  // configure a FairHandicapper to be injected for requests of a Handicapper
  // that are qualified with an @Named("fair") qualifier annotation
  container.addImplType(FairHandicapper.class)
           .asStrictBinding()
           .forSpecificTypes(Handicapper.class)
           .whenQualifiedWith(Qualifiers.named("fair"));
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Injecting Parameterized Types</h3>
        
        <p>Configuring parameterized types is supported by using the
            {@link hammer.api.TypeToken} class available in the API.  For example:
        </p>
        
        <pre>
  container.addImplType(MyIntegerSet.class)
           .asStrictBinding()
           .forSpecificTypes(new TypeToken&#060;Set&#060;Integer&#062;&#062;() {});
        </pre>
        
        <h2>Static Injection</h2>

        <p>Static injection is supported at {@code Injector} creation time via calls to
            the {@link hammer.api.Container#configureStaticInjections} method.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Collection Injection</h2>
        
        <p>See the {@link hammer.api.Container} class and its nested classes
            for more details on collection injection.</p>
        
        <h2>Using Scopes</h2>
        
        <p>See the {@link hammer.api.Container#activateScopes} method and the
            {@link hammer.api.Injector#enterScope} method for more details on
            support for scopes.</p>
